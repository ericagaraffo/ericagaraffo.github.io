Erica Garaffo is a full-time data analyst for the City of San Jose and a part-time farmer at her homestead in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  During the week, Erica is one of the two members of the City's Data Analytics Team in the City Manager's Office.

The Data Analytics Team is responsible for helping departments make better use of their data with the intent of improving business process and city services for the residents of San Jose.  Erica is also the leader of the Data Champions, a monthly informal seminar for City employees to gather and learn new skills, discuss cool projects, and network with fellow data enthusiasts. 

Erica's work on the Data Analytics Team also includes managing the Open Data Portal `www.data.sanjoseca.gov`.  Her hope is to one day see that all City data, the public's data, is readily available and easily accessed for any member of the public to use.
